# GopherExchange

Goucher College Fall 2021 Senior Project by Nodar Sotkilava

## About the Project

At the end of each semester, Goucher students give away books, unused school
supplies and other possessions that they might not need. Most students make posts on the
GopherApp announcing that they are giving away stuff, but sometimes those posts are
missed by the conversation happening around them. GopherExchange is a Craigslist-
inspired web application where Goucher students can make listings to give away or
exchange books, school supplies, and/or belongings.
